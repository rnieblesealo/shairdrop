# SHAirDrop

*It's like AirDrop, except you can only share small images, it's written in C, needs you to use a command line, will spuriously break and catch fire in unexpected circumstances (as a feature), and honestly just kind of hates you.*

"ShairDrop" = *Shit AirDrop* or *Shell AirDrop* or *Share Drop*... I don't fucking know make it what you want. Who am I to tell you what to do?
